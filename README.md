# Password-Generator

## Bootcamp homework #3

A user wants a webpage that offers the option of generating a strong random password to protect sensitive data. The following "Acceptance Criteria" for this feature were requested and have now been implemented:

- Clicking the button on the webpage (to generate a new password) results in a series of window-based prompts indicating password criteria.
- These prompts allow the user to select from the following:

1. Length: The length of the password must be at least 8 characters and no more than 128.
2. Character types: The user can choose whether or not to include: lowercase; uppercase; numeric; and/or special characters. _At least one character type needs to be selected._

- If prompts are not answered successfully, an error message appears and/or the user is returned to the original prompt indicating necessary parameters for the password.
- When all prompts are successfully answered, a password is generated that meets the selected criteria.
- The password then appears in the designated box on the webpage.

Additionally, there are no errors in the console when it is inspected using Chrome DevTools
and the CSS includes comments.
